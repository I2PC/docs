The set of particles has to be at full size (the finer sampling rate available), but        the rest of inputs (reference volume and masks) can be at any downsampling factor.        The protocol scales the input images and volumes to a reasonable size depending on        the resolution of the previous iteration.                The protocol works with any input volume, whichever its resolution, as long as it        is a reasonable initial volume for the set of particles. The protocol does not        resolve the heterogeneous problem (it assumes an homogeneous population),        although it is somewhat tolerant through the use of particle weights in the        reconstruction process.                It is recommended to perform several global alignment iterations before entering        into the local iterations. The switch from global to local should be performed when        a substantial percentage of the particles do not move from one iteration to the next.                The algorithm reports the cross correlation (global alignment) or cost (local) function        per defocus group, so that we can see which was the percentile of each particle in its        defocus group. You may want to perform iterations one by one, and remove from one        iteration to the next, those particles that worse fit the model.",
