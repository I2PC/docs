Installation with Scipion
------------------------------

The recommended way for users (not developers) to install and use Xmipp is via the 
`Scipion framework <https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/release-3.0.0/docs/scipion-modes/how-to-install.html>`_, 
where you can use Xmipp with other Cryo-EM-related software. Xmipp will be installed during Scipion installation 
(pay attention to not include the flag *-noXmipp*).
You can also install Xmipp from the `plugin manager of Scipion <https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/release-3.0.0/docs/scipion-modes/how-to-install.html#installing-other-plugins>`_
