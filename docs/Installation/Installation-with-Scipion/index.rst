Installation with Scipion
-----------------------

The recommended way for users (not developers) to install and use Xmipp is via the `Scipion framework`, where you can use Xmipp with other Cryo-EM-related software. Xmipp will be installed during Scipion installation (pay attention to the -noXmipp flag).
