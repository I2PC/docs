Welcome to Xmipp documentation!
========================================
drawing

Xmipp is a suite of image processing programs, primarily aimed at single-particle 3D electron microscopy, 
designed and managed by the `Biocomputing Unit <http://biocomputingunit.es/>` located in Madrid, Spain.

The Xmipp project is divided into four repositories:`xmipp <https://github.com/I2PC/xmipp>`,
 `xmippCore <>`, `scipion-em-xmipp <https://github.com/I2PC/scipion-em-xmipp>` and `xmippVix <https://github.com/I2PC/xmippViz>`, 
 are automatically downloaded during the installation process.

Getting started
----------------
The recommended way for users (not developers) to install and use Xmipp is via the Scipion
 framework, where you can use Xmipp with other Cryo-EM-related software. Xmipp will be installed during Scipion installation 
 (pay attemption on the -noXmipp flag). The Scipion installer should take care of all dependencies for you, however, you can make 
 its life easier if you have your compiler, CUDA and HDF5 library ready and available in the standard paths. Read the installation 
 page for more details about these softwares requirements. Follow the official installation guide of Scipion for more details.
